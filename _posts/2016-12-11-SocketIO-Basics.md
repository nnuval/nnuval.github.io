One of the assignments in my Applications of Databases class involved building a chat app using Flask-SocketIO and AngularJS.
This post isn't a tutorial; Dr. Zacharski has an excellent video tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/5cQFzc_Zo8M">here</a>

You have cloned the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/zacharski/ISSchat.git
