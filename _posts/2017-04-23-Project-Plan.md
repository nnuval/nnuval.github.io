title: From Requirements To Project Plan
author: Nate Nuval

The Software Engineering course at the University of Mary Washington gave me hands on experience with developing programs. In my other computer science classes, the professor gives us a programming assignment and we are given a grade based on the completeness of the program. This class broke the mold. At the beginning of the semester we were put into groups and assigned a client. The client was some member of the UMW community who needed custom software. We then meet with the client and collected/documented their requirements into a software requirements document. In the real world, rarely will you develop software for requirements that you personally have collected. So we were placed in different groups and given the requirements documents of a project that we haven’t seen yet. We were expected to use the requirements document and meet with the client to create a Project Plan Document for that project. Here is the Project Plan Document my team and I created:

This assignment gave me insight to how the software development process occurs in the real world. It gave me experience with taking requirements, breaking them down into tasks, organizing them based on importance and dependencies, and creating a schedule for the team. I think the biggest lesson here was that optimism is not always a positive thing. As you’ll see in a later post in relation to this software, only a fraction of what we wanted to accomplish was completed.
