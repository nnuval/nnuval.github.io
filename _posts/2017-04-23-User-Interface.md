title: Usability Study

Another assignment from my Software Engineering course was to conduct a usability study. A usability study is a technique used in user-centered interation design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. The software project my team and I were working on was the Mice Visualization Software. 

You can learn about that and our plan on building it over here on this blog post: <a href="https://nnuval.github.io/2017/04/23/Project-Plan.html">From Requirements To Project Plan</a>

Because our software needed to have an intuitive graphical user interface, a usability study was beneficial to our project. 
I interviewed 4 people in my study. The first thing I did was gave them a background on what the software is designed to do, and who would be using it. I then put them in the shoes of the user stating, you have just opened the application, imported your data, defined the grid, and selected the mice you would like to see. I gave them this blank skeleton and began to jot down there thoughts and ideas.

The main things I was looking for was: 

Where would the map go?<br /> 
How would you control the animations?<br />
What other features should be present? <br />
Which of the things you have told me would be of highest importance to you?

I took the ideas that all 4 interviews had in common as well as the things that the individuals claimed were of high importance and designed a UI.

Everyone stated that:
The map should be center-rightish of the app.<br />
Checkboxes should be present to select and deselect mice.<br />
Animation controls should work similarly to YouTube.<br />
A map key should be on the right of the map.

Functions for importing the data, saving the data set, and exporting the map should be available in the file menu drop down.

Functions for changing between a Heat map and a Vector map should be present as well.


After creating these UI designs, I showed each person what I created. I was exactly what they were expecting. The only suggestions they had were some form of labeling each box in the grid.

So I returned to them with this.

This assignment gave me insight into creating UIâ€™s that are intuitive. It turns out that most people have a common idea of how applications should look. If your design follows what people are used to, then your application will be easy to use. If I could go back and do this assignment again, I would have limited the functionality available for the study. As you will see in a different post where I demo the software, the design turned out very different. This was because were only able to complete a fraction of the requirements.
