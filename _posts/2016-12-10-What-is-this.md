### Welcome to my blog!
You're probably asking yourself "Uhh hey Nate... what's this all about?" Good question friend.


#### My blog is for:

1. Talking about some of the interesting things i've learned throughout my life
2. Showcasing some of my projects
3. Displaying my skills with a clean, beautiful website

...and maybe this is graded. BUT it's not about the grade.
The usefulness of this assignment goes far beyond an A or a 100%. Before this I did not know that you could host a site
on GitHub (thank you GitHub for your generosity). I didn't know what Jekyll was or how awesome Jekyll is 
(thank you Jekyll for your awesomeness). And thank you Dr. Zacharski for an assignment that will benefit me as a working 
professional. So feel free to peruse around. If there is a typo, incorrect information, or if you are curious about anything
you find here send me an email natenuval@yahoo.com.
