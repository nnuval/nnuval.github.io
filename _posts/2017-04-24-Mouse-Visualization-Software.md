The Software Engineering course I took centered around the development process in the real world. We were put into teams and given a client. We gathered requirements from a client and wrote a Requirements Document. We were placed in a different team and given a different client/project. We used the Requirements Documents for that project and created a Project Plan and began building the software. After about a month of the implementation phase we created a Test Plan document. Which we gave to a testing team to conduct tests on our software. We used the results of the test to improve our program. At the end of the semester we turned in the application we built. 
If you are looking for more information on our project check this post out: <a href="https://nnuval.github.io/2017/04/23/Project-Plan.html">From Requirements To Project Plan</a>

The following are a series of short videos showing our application at work.

This was the first time my team members and I created a standalone Java application with a GUI. Our program also uses Python, Plot.ly and JavaScript. Although we are very proud of our application, there were some basic functionality that we were not able to complete. The ability to select the start and end times was not finished, exporting the map as an image was not completed, and in order to generate a new map, the user has to close out the entire application. If I could go back and do this project again, I would have dedicated more time to it. Building GUIâ€™s and using different languages in one application was new to us. A lot of the time was dedicated to learning how to do everything. Still, I think we have a pretty cool prototype.
