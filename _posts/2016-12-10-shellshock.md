During my Operating Systems course we explored the bash vulnerability famously referred to as "Shellshock".
This was my first experience doing a lab related to cyber security field and it definitely opened my eyes to how small 
bugs in a program can lead to information being stolen, privileged data being accessed by non-privileged users, or
even complete control of a computer remotely! The following is my write up for a lab based off of the SEED lab "Shellshock".
Which can be found here http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_12.04/Software/Shellshock/.
