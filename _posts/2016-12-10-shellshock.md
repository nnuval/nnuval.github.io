title: "Shellshock Vulnerability"
author: "Nate Nuval"

During my Operating Systems course we explored the bash vulnerability famously referred to as "Shellshock".
This was my first experience doing a lab related to cyber security. It definitely opened my eyes to how small 
bugs in a program can lead to information being stolen, privileged data being accessed by non-privileged users, or
even complete control of a computer remotely! The following is my write up for a lab based off of the SEED lab "Shellshock".
Which can be found here <a href="http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_12.04/Software/Shellshock/">http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_12.04/Software/Shellshock/</a>
