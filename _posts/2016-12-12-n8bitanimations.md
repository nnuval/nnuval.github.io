 In 2014 I created n8bitanimations, a company that designs and develops games for mobile devices.

 I was looking for a hobby that uses the skills that I’ve obtained throughout my computer science education and that involves 
 creativity and artwork. The game itself was built with GameSalad Creator, a visual editor and a behavior-based logic system. 
 GameSalad made the programming, and publishing easy. All the characters were created using photoshop. So far I have one game 
 available on the Google Play store, Windy City Red Hots: The Game.

 The game is based off of my family’s restaurant where we serve classic Chicago street food. A Windy City Red Hot (a traditional 
 Chicago-style hotdog) comes with mustard, relish, onions, tomatoes, sport peppers, pickles, and celery salt.

Never ketchup! Putting ketchup on a hotdog is a sin. That is the basic idea of the game. 


The first thing I animated was the Windy City Red Hots food truck.

games.
